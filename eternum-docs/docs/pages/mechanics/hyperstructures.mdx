# Hyperstructures

Hyperstructures are massive social engineering projects.

## Construction Process

Initiating a Hyperstructure requires Ancient Fragments, precious artifacts that can only be obtained from Fragment
mines. Once you have the necessary Fragments, you can begin construction at any discovered location on the map.

### Contribution Modes

- **Public Mode**: Opens construction to all players
- **Tribe-only Mode**: Restricts contributions to members of the owner's tribe

### Building Requirements

Construction of a Hyperstructure demands careful resource management and coordination:

- Requires contributions of all 22 resource types
- Multiple players can participate in the construction
- Structure becomes operational once all requirements are met

## Victory Points System

Hyperstructures offer two distinct ways to earn victory points.

### Construction Points

When a Hyperstructure is completed, contributors receive one-time point rewards based on:

- The quantity of resources they contributed
- The rarity value of their contributed resources

Points are calculated and distributed automatically upon construction completion.

### Generation Points

Once operational, Hyperstructures become ongoing sources of points:

- Points are generated each Eternum cycle
- Distribution follows a share-based system
- The structure owner controls share allocation
- Share modifications have a 48-hour cooldown period

## ðŸ’¡ Strategic Considerations

ðŸ’¡ **Management**

> - Plan resource gathering before initialization
> - Consider tribe-only mode for security
> - Defend completed structures to maintain control
> - New owner gains share control upon capture
> - Previous share settings reset on capture
