# Hyperstructures

## Construction Process

> 🏗️ **Initialization**
>
> - Requires Ancient Fragments to start construction
> - Can be placed anywhere on the map
> - Two contribution modes:
>   - Public: Anyone can contribute
>   - Tribe-only: Limited to owner's tribe members

### Building Requirements

> 📦 **Resource Contributions**
>
> - Requires all 22 resource types
> - Multiple players can contribute
> - Construction complete when all requirements met

## Points System

### Construction Points

> 🎯 **One-time Rewards**
>
> - Contributors earn points upon completion
> - Points based on:
>   - Amount of resources contributed
>   - Rarity of contributed resources
> - Awarded once construction is complete

### Generation Points

> ⚡ **Ongoing Points**
>
> - Begins after construction is complete
> - Generates points every Eternum cycle
> - Points distributed via share system
> - Owner controls share distribution
> - Share changes restricted to 48-hour cooldown

## Strategic Considerations

> 💡 **Management**
>
> - Plan resource gathering before initialization
> - Consider tribe-only mode for security
> - Defend completed structures to maintain control
> - New owner gains share control upon capture
> - Previous share settings reset on capture
