# Seasons

Eternum utilizes a seasonal system to maintain a fresh and exciting metagame, leveraging its unique two-layer
architecture to enable dynamic gameplay experiences.

## Overview

Seasons in Eternum are distinct gameplay periods that operate under specific rules and logic while maintaining certain
persistent elements (such as resources) across different seasons.

This system allows for regular refreshes of the game meta and introduces new mechanics without completely resetting
player progress.

## Season Structure

### Active Season

- Each season runs with predefined rules and victory conditions
- Concludes with a specific end state
- Once concluded, no further actions can be taken in that season

### Between Seasons

Between seasons, there is a cooldown period lasting several weeks that serves multiple purposes:

- Implementation of new features
- Patching of identified issues
- Preparation for the upcoming season
- Community feedback and adjustment period

## Persistence and Reset

While seasons introduce new mechanics and rules, certain elements persist across seasons:

- Core resources
- Player achievements
- Other fundamental progression elements

## Development Opportunities

The seasonal structure enables developers to:

- Fork the game to create parallel versions
- Experiment with different gameplay mechanics
- Create variations such as:
  - Low-cost variants of the world
  - Modified physics or rule sets
  - Experimental gameplay modes

## Victory and Rewards

### Winning Conditions

Winning in Eternum is multifaceted and depends on your personal goals. While total victory requires collaboration
between players to dominate the map, there are many paths to success:

- Trading optimization
- Realm raiding for resources
- Earning service fees from other players
- Accumulating Hyperstructure points

### Season Rewards

#### Individual Leaderboard

The individual rewards system is based on Victory Points (VP). Any player who earns VP during the season is eligible for
rewards. The payout is directly proportional to the percentage of total VP earned:

- If you earned 5% of all VP during the season, you receive 5% of the individual prize pool
- All VP-earning players receive rewards, regardless of ranking
- Rewards are calculated using: `(Your VP / Total VP) * Prize Pool`

#### Guild Leaderboard (Season 0)

For Season 0, an additional prize pool is dedicated for the guild leaderboard. The top 10 guilds share the guild prize
pool according to the following structure:

- 1st Place: 30%
- 2nd Place: 20%
- 3rd Place: 13%
- 4th Place: 9%
- 5th Place: 7%
- 6th Place: 5%
- 7th Place: 4%
- 8th Place: 3%
- 9th Place: 2%
- 10th Place: 1%
