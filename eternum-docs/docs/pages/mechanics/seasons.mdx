# Seasons

Eternum utilizes a seasonal system to maintain a fresh and exciting metagame, leveraging its unique two-layer
architecture to enable dynamic gameplay experiences.

## Overview

Seasons in Eternum are distinct gameplay periods that operate under specific rules and logic while maintaining certain
persistent elements (such as resources) across different seasons. This system allows for regular refreshes of the game
meta and introduces new mechanics without completely resetting player progress.

## Season Structure

### Active Season

- Each season runs with predefined rules and victory conditions
- Concludes with a specific end state
- Once concluded, no further actions can be taken in that season

### Between Seasons

Between seasons, there is a cooldown period lasting several weeks that serves multiple purposes:

- Implementation of new features
- Patching of identified issues
- Preparation for the upcoming season
- Community feedback and adjustment period

## Persistence and Reset

While seasons introduce new mechanics and rules, certain elements persist across seasons:

- Core resources
- Player achievements
- Other fundamental progression elements

## Development Opportunities

The seasonal structure enables developers to:

- Fork the game to create parallel versions
- Experiment with different gameplay mechanics
- Create variations such as:
  - Low-cost variants of the world
  - Modified physics or rule sets
  - Experimental gameplay modes

## Victory and Rewards

### Winning Conditions

Winning in Eternum is multifaceted and depends on your personal goals. While total victory requires collaboration
between players to dominate the map, there are many paths to success:

- Trading optimization
- Realm raiding for resources
- Earning service fees from other players
- Accumulating Hyperstructure points

### Season Rewards

Drawing inspiration from the World Series of Poker, Eternum implements a tiered payout system for the top 50 players
based on their final ranking. The prize pool is distributed as follows:

#### Payout Structure

- 1st Place: 20% of prize pool
- 2nd Place: 12% of prize pool
- 3rd Place: 8% of prize pool
- 4th-10th Place: 15% (distributed proportionally)
- 11th-20th Place: 15% (distributed proportionally)
- 21st-50th Place: 30% (distributed proportionally)

This structure ensures that:

- Top 50 players receive rewards
- Payouts are proportional to player ranking
- Higher ranks receive exponentially larger payouts
