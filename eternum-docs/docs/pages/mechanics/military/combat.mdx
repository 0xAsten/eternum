## Combat System

### Unit Advantages

⚔️ **Combat Advantages**

The combat system features a strategic triangle of unit advantages:

- **Paladins** excel against Crossbowmen
- **Crossbowmen** dominate Knights
- **Knights** overpower Paladins

_Each unit deals bonus damage to their advantage target and receives reduced damage from them._

### Battle Duration

Combat duration scales dynamically with army sizes. Larger armies naturally result in longer engagements, while highly
uneven matchups may resolve more quickly as the stronger force overwhelms their opponent.

### Battle Dynamics

Combat in Eternum is dynamic and fluid. Additional armies can reinforce either side during battle, and fighting
continues until victory is achieved or retreat is called.

Retreating forces pay a steep price: deserting armies lose 25% of their troops during withdrawal.

### Siege Mechanics

🏰 **Siege System**

> When attacking a realm, combat begins with a siege phase.
>
> Defenders can use this time to:
>
> - Transfer resources in or out of the realm
> - Prepare defenses
> - Launch an early counterattack to break the siege

> Once combat begins, the realm enters active attack status and all resource transfers are blocked.
