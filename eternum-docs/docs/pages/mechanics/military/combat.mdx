## Combat System

### Unit Advantages

> ⚔️ **Combat Matchups**
>
> ```
> Paladins    →  Crossbowmen
> Crossbowmen →  Knights
> Knights     →  Paladins
> ```
>
> Units deal more damage to their strong matchup and less damage to their weak matchup.

### Battle Duration

- Combat duration is dynamically calculated based on army sizes
- Larger armies result in longer battles
- Highly uneven matchups may resolve more quickly

### Battle Dynamics

- Additional armies can join either side during ongoing combat
- Combat continues until one side is defeated or retreats

### Siege Mechanics

> 🏰 **Siege System**
>
> - Attacking a realm initiates a siege phase before combat
> - During siege phase:
>   - Defenders can prepare defenses
>   - Resources can be transferred in/out of the realm
>   - Defenders can "break" the siege by initiating combat early
> - Once combat begins:
>   - Resource transfers are blocked
>   - The realm is considered under active attack
