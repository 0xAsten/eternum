### Units

> 🎯 **Unit Types**
>
> - **Paladins**
>   - Larger energy pool for extended movement
>   - Same energy regeneration rate as other units
>   - Can cover more distance in a single move
> - **Crossbowmen**
>   - Reduced food consumption (50% less)
>   - More efficient for exploration and movement
> - **Knights**
>   - Standard unit with baseline stats

### Army Energy System

> ⚡ **Energy Mechanics**
>
> - Army's maximum energy is determined by its composition
> - The unit with the lowest energy pool sets the army's limit
> - Energy regenerates at a fixed rate for all unit types every Eternum cycle
> - Energy is consumed when moving across tiles

## Army Movement

### Energy Consumption

> 🏃 **Movement Mechanics**
>
> - Moving armies requires energy
> - Each tile crossed consumes energy
> - Food is consumed during movement

### Unit-Specific Movement

> 💨 **Movement Traits**
>
> - **Paladins**
>   - Larger energy pool for extended movement
>   - Takes longer to fully recharge energy
> - **Crossbowmen**
>   - Uses 50% less food while moving
>   - Ideal for long-distance exploration
> - **Knights**
>   - Standard movement costs
>   - Standard food consumption
