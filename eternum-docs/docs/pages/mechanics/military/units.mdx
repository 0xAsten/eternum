### Units

**Unit Types**

- **Paladins** <img src="/resources/252.png" alt="Market" width="100" className="float-right" />
  - Larger energy pool for extended movement
  - Same energy regeneration rate as other units
  - Can cover more distance in a single move

<br />

- **Crossbowmen** <img src="/resources/251.png" alt="Market" width="100" className="float-right" />
  - Reduced food consumption (50% less)
  - More efficient for exploration and movement

<br />

- **Knights** <img src="/resources/250.png" alt="Market" width="100" className="float-right" />
  - Standard unit with baseline stats

### Army Energy System

‚ö° **Energy Mechanics**

- Army's maximum energy is determined by its composition
- The unit with the lowest energy pool sets the army's limit
- Energy regenerates at a fixed rate for all unit types every Eternum cycle
- Energy is consumed when moving across tiles

## Army Movement

### Energy Consumption

üèÉ **Movement Mechanics**

- Moving armies requires energy
- Each tile crossed consumes energy
- Food is consumed during movement

### Unit-Specific Movement

üí® **Movement Traits**

- **Paladins**
  - Larger energy pool for extended movement
  - Takes longer to fully recharge energy
- **Crossbowmen**
  - Uses 50% less food while moving
  - Ideal for long-distance exploration
- **Knights**
  - Standard movement costs
  - Standard food consumption
