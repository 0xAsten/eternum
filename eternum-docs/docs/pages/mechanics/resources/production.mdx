## Production

### Resource Requirements

- Most resources require other resources as inputs for production
- Food is the only resource that can be produced without input resources
- Each resource has specific input requirements that must be met
  > Example: Wood production requires Stone, Coal and Wheat as inputs

### Automated Production

- Production buildings will automatically produce resources when:
  - All required input resources are available
  - The building is not paused
  - Storage capacity is not full

### Resource Management

- Monitor your resource levels carefully
- Production will continue consuming inputs even if some required resources are missing
- When inputs are missing, no output will be produced but resources will still be consumed

> ⚠️ **Important**  
> To optimize resource efficiency:
>
> - Keep track of input resource levels
> - Pause production buildings when input resources are running low
> - Resume production once you have sufficient input resources
> - Consider setting up alerts or reminders to check resource levels
