## Production

- Every resource, with the exception of food, requires other resources to be produced.

    > Ex: to produce Wood, you need Stone, Coal and Wheat.

- Production will work automatically until paused or resources are depleted
    
    > ⚠️ **Warning**  
    > If some of the input resources required aren't available:
    > - Available resources will still be consumed
    > - No output will be produced
    > 
    > To prevent resource waste, manually pause buildings when resources are low.
