## Storage System

Storage is a crucial mechanic in Eternum that limits how many resources your realm can hold at once. Understanding and
managing your storage capacity is essential for efficient resource management and realm development.

### Resource Weights

Each resource in Eternum has a specific weight:

- Most basic resources (Wood, Stone, Coal, etc.) weigh 1kg per unit
- Military units weight 5kg:
- Food resources (Wheat, Fish) are lighter at 0.1kg per unit
- The 'Lords' is the lightest at 0.001kg

The weight of resources directly impacts how much you can store in your storehouses.

### Storehouses

- Each storehouse provides 300,000kg of storage capacity for each resource type
- Build storehouses to increase your realm's total storage capacity
- When storage is full:
  - Production continues but output is wasted
  - Input resources are still consumed

### Storage Management
