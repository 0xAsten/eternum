## Storage System

Storage limits how many resources your realm can hold. Managing your storage capacity effectively is key to developing your realm.

### Resource Weights

Resources in Eternum have different weights that affect storage:

- Basic resources (Wood, Stone, Coal): 1kg per unit
- Military units: 5kg per unit 
- Food (Wheat, Fish): 0.1kg per unit
- Lords: 0.001kg per unit

### Storehouses

- Each storehouse adds 300,000kg storage capacity per resource
- Build more storehouses to increase total storage
- When storage is full:
  - New production is wasted
  - Input resources continue to be consumed
