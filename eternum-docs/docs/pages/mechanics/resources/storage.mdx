## Storage System

Storage limits how many resources your realm can hold. Managing your storage capacity effectively is key to developing
your realm.

### Resource Weights

Resources in Eternum have different weights that affect storage:

- Basic resources (Wood, Stone, Coal): 1kg per unit
- Military units: 5kg per unit
- Food (Wheat, Fish): 0.1kg per unit
- Lords: 0.001kg per unit

### Storehouses <img src="/buildings/storehouse.png" alt="Storehouse" width="300" className="float-right"/>


Expand your storage capacity to support your growing realm:

- **Capacity**: Each storehouse adds 300,000kg of storage per per resource
- **Expansion**: Build additional storehouses to increase total storage.

- **When storage is full**:
  - New production is wasted
  - Input resources continue to be consumed
