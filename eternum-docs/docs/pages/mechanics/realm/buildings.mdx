# Buildings

Buildings are essential structures in your realm that provide various benefits. Each construction increases the cost of
subsequent buildings of the same type exponentially.

## Building Types

### Basic Infrastructure

🏘️ **Worker's Hut**

- Basic population housing
- Provides population capacity

🏪 **Storehouse**

- Increases resource storage capacity
- Essential for resource management
- Prevents production waste
- Consider building more when storage is frequently full

### Production Buildings

🌾 **Farm**

- Produces Wheat
- No input resources required
- Provides 10% production bonus to adjacent buildings
- Strategic placement is key for optimization

🐟 **Fishing Village**

- Produces Fish
- No input resources required

💰 **Market**

- Produces Donkeys
- Essential to keep a constant trading flow
- Essential for economic growth

**Resource Facility**

- Produces specified resource
- Consumes some of your other realms' resources

### Military Buildings

**Military Production Buildings:**

- **Barracks:** Knights
- **Stables:** Paladins
- **Archery Range:** Crossbowmen
- Each military building increases max army count by 1 (up to +3)

### Production Management

⚙️ **Production Controls**

- Buildings can be paused/resumed
- Pausing stops:
- Resource consumption
- Resource production
- Use pausing to:
  - Prevent resource waste
  - Manage storage capacity

### Building Costs

💰 **Cost Scaling**

- Each building has a base resource cost
- Subsequent buildings of same type cost more
- Cost increase is exponential
- Example progression:
  - First Worker's Hut: 100 wood
  - Second Worker's Hut: 200 wood
  - Third Worker's Hut: 400 wood
  - ...

### Construction Management

🏗️ **Building Tips**

> - Prioritize buildings based on your realm's needs
> - Consider population increase and capacity
> - Monitor resource production and storage capacity
> - See Production Management section for resource conservation strategies
