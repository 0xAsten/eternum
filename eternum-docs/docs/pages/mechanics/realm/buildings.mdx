# Buildings

Buildings are essential structures in your realm that provide various benefits. Each construction increases the cost of
subsequent buildings of the same type exponentially.

## Building Types

### Basic Infrastructure

**Worker's Hut** <img src="/buildings/workers_hut.png" alt="Worker's Hut" width="300" className="float-right"/>

- Basic population housing
- Provides population capacity

<br />

**Storehouse** <img src="/buildings/storehouse.png" alt="Storehouse" width="300" className="float-right"/>

- Increases resource storage capacity
- Essential for resource management
- Prevents production waste
- Consider building more when storage is frequently full

<br />
<br />

### Production Buildings

**Farm** <img src="/buildings/farm.png" alt="Farm" width="300" className="float-right"/>

- Produces Wheat
- No input resources required
- Provides 10% production bonus to adjacent buildings
- Strategic placement is key for optimization

<br />
<br />

**Fishing Village**

- Produces Fish
- No input resources required

<br />
<br />

**Market** <img src="/buildings/market.png" alt="Market" width="300" className="float-right" />

- Produces Donkeys
- Essential to keep a constant trading flow
- Essential for economic growth

<br />
<br />

**Resource Facility**

<div className="flex">
  <img src="/buildings/forge.png" alt="Forge" width="200" />
  <img src="/buildings/lumber_mill.png" alt="Lumber Mill" width="200" />
  <img src="/buildings/mine.png" alt="Mine" width="200" />
</div>

- Produces specified resource
- Consumes some of your other realms' resources

<br />
<br />

### Military Buildings

**Military Production Buildings:**

<div className="flex items-center">
  <img src="/buildings/barracks.png" alt="Barracks" width="300" className="float-left" />
  <p> **Barracks:** Produces Knights </p>
</div>

<div className="flex items-center">
  <img src="/buildings/stable.png" alt="Stables" width="300" className="float-left" />
  <p> **Stables:** Produces Paladins </p>
</div>

<div className="flex items-center">
  <img src="/buildings/archery.png" alt="Archery Range" width="300" className="float-left" />
  <p> **Archery Range:** Crossbowmen </p>
</div>

> Each military building increases max army count by 1 (up to +3)

### Production Management

⚙️ **Production Controls**

- Buildings can be paused/resumed
- Pausing stops:
- Resource consumption
- Resource production
- Use pausing to:
  - Prevent resource waste
  - Manage storage capacity

### Building Costs

💰 **Cost Scaling**

- Each building has a base resource cost
- Subsequent buildings of same type cost more
- Cost increase is exponential
- Example progression:
  - First Worker's Hut: 100 wood
  - Second Worker's Hut: 200 wood
  - Third Worker's Hut: 400 wood
  - ...

### Construction Management

🏗️ **Building Tips**

> - Prioritize buildings based on your realm's needs
> - Consider population increase and capacity
> - Monitor resource production and storage capacity
> - See Production Management section for resource conservation strategies
