# Buildings

Buildings are essential structures in your realm that provide various benefits. Each construction increases the cost of
subsequent buildings of the same type exponentially.

## Building Types

### Basic Infrastructure

> 🏘️ **Worker's Hut**
>
> - Basic population housing
> - Provides population capacity

> 🏪 **Storehouse**
>
> - Increases resource storage capacity
> - Essential for resource management
> - Prevents production waste
> - Consider building more when storage is frequently full

### Production Buildings

> 🌾 **Farm**
>
> - Produces Wheat for population and armies
> - Provides 10% production bonus to adjacent buildings
> - Strategic placement is key for optimization

> **Fishing Village**
>
> - Produces Fish for population and armies

> 💰 **Market**
>
> - Produces Donkeys
> - Essential to keep a constant trading flow
> - Essential for economic growth

> **Resource Facility**
>
> - Produces specified resource
> - Consumes some of your other realms' resources

### Military Buildings

> **Available military buildings and their units:**
>
> - **Barracks:** Knights
> - **Stables:** Paladins
> - **Archery Range:** Crossbowmen
> - Each military building also increases your max army count by 1 (up to 3, for a total of 6)

#### Army Size Bonus

> Each military building increases your maximum army count by 1, up to a maximum of 3 buildings (for a total bonus of +3
> to army size).

### Production Management

> ⚙️ **Production Controls**
>
> - Buildings can be paused/resumed
> - Pausing stops:
>   - Resource consumption
>   - Resource production
> - Use pausing to:
>   - Prevent resource waste
>   - Manage storage capacity

### Building Costs

> 💰 **Cost Scaling**
>
> - Each building has a base resource cost
> - Subsequent buildings of same type cost more
> - Cost increase is exponential
> - Example progression:
>   - First Worker's Hut: 100 wood
>   - Second Worker's Hut: 200 wood
>   - Third Worker's Hut: 400 wood
>   - And so on...

### Construction Management

> 🏗️ **Building Tips**
>
> - Prioritize buildings based on your realm's needs
> - Consider population increase and capacity
> - Monitor resource production and storage capacity
> - See Production Management section for resource conservation strategies
