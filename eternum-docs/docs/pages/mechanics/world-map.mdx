# World Map

Eternum takes place on an infinite, recursive hexagonal grid that scales dynamically with the player population. Players
spawn in concentric circles radiating from the map's center, ensuring optimal scalability. Distance is a crucial
gameplay mechanic, affecting everything from trade to army movement through time-based constraints.
