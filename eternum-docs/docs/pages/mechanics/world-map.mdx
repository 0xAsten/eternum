# 🌎 World Map

Eternum unfolds on an infinite, recursive hexagonal grid that scales with the player population.

Players spawn in concentric circles radiating from the map's center, ensuring optimal scalability.

Distance plays a crucial role, influencing trade and army movement through time-based constraints.

## Travel & Exploration

Armies can traverse through hexes that have already been discovered or venture into unexplored ones. This movement
consumes energy and depletes food supplies from their realm.

During exploration, armies have the opportunity to obtain random resources.

Additionally, there is a small chance of discovering a Fragment mine.

## Fragment Mines

Fragment mines are the only source of Ancient Fragments and are found through exploration.

Each mine is defended by a random number of bandits and contains food resources.

Mines have a fixed total capacity of Ancient Fragments and cannot produce more once depleted.

**Production**

> - Automatic production once claimed
> - No input resources required
> - Produces until reaching total capacity
> - Cannot be replenished once depleted

**Combat Strategy**

> When a mine is under attack:
