[Read our detailed vision document â†’](https://github.com/BibliothecaDAO/world-guide/blob/main/realms-world-guide-v1.0.0.pdf)

## Core Pillars

### True Ownership

> Assets exist on the blockchain, giving players real ownership and trading power over their resources and land.

### Player-Driven Economy

> From resource production to market prices, the economy lives and breathes by player actions.

### Strategic Depth

> Success requires mastery of resource management, territorial control, and combat. Every decision matters.

### Community Governance

> Form tribes, build alliances, and shape the political landscape. The strongest leaders unite players toward common
> goals.
