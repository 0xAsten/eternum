# Game Entry & Participation

## Realm Holder Entry

### Season Access

Realm holders enjoy exclusive benefits, including free entry into each new Season. This access is granted through
tokenized Season tickets, which can be sold or transferred if the holder opts not to participate.

### Continuous Play

As long as you maintain in-game Realm ownership, you can actively participate without additional entry fees. Engage in
the market using $LORDS tokens and enjoy uninterrupted gameplay.

### Realm Control Mechanics

> ⚔️ **Takeover System**
>
> Realms can be conquered within a Season, leading to a temporary loss of control for the original owner. Gameplay
> rights are restored at the start of the next Season, ensuring a dynamic and competitive environment.

## Non-Realm Holder Entry

> ⚠️ **Coming Soon**
>
> Synthetic Realms will be introduced in future seasons. This feature is not available during Season 0.

### Synthetic Realms (Future Feature)

During gameplay, Realm holders will have the opportunity to discover Synthetic Realms. These discovered Realms can then
be auctioned using $LORDS, allowing non-Realm holders to participate in the game through temporary ownership for the
current Season. Auction fees will be distributed through the game fee system.
