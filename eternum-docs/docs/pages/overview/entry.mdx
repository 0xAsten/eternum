# Game Entry & Participation

## Season Access

### Realm Holder Entry <img src="/ring_pass.png" alt="Season entry" width="300" className=" float-right" />

Realm holders enjoy exclusive benefits, including free entry into each new Season.

This access is granted through Season tickets.

- Mint your ticket [here](https://empire.realms.world/)

### Non-Realm Holder Entry

#### Market Place

Should a Realm Holder decide not to play with his season ticket, he/she can sell it on the
[Realms MarketPlace](https://market.realms.world/)

#### Synthetic Realms

> ⚠️ **Coming Soon**
>
> Synthetic Realms will be introduced in future seasons. This feature is not available during Season 0.

During gameplay, Realm holders will have the opportunity to discover Synthetic Realms. These discovered Realms can then
be auctioned using $LORDS, allowing non-Realm holders to participate in the game through temporary ownership for the
current Season. Auction fees will be distributed through the game fee system.

### Continuous Play

As long as you maintain in-game Realm ownership, you can actively participate without additional entry fees. Engage in
the market using $LORDS tokens and enjoy uninterrupted gameplay.

### Realm Control Mechanics

> ⚔️ **Takeover System**
>
> Realms can be conquered within a Season, leading to a temporary loss of control for the original owner. Gameplay
> rights are restored at the start of the next Season, ensuring a dynamic and competitive environment.
