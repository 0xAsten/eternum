# Bridge Closure

<Callout type="danger">
  Important information – Game Bridge **permanently** closes **48 hours** after victory has been claimed. <br />

</Callout>

## Bridging in Eternum

Eternum is a fully on-chain game with immutable smart contracts, meaning the game rules cannot be altered after
deployment. Bridging tokens in and out of the game is a core mechanic, but you must carefully manage this process. The
game bridge closes **forever** 48 hours after the game ends (victory claimed). Any tokens left in the game at that time
are **permanently locked** in the contract (effectively **burned**).

Bridging out of the game is done by sending resources to a bank. This process takes **time and requires donkeys** as
part of the gameplay mechanics. Since the contracts are immutable, "code is law." Players must plan accordingly, as the
developers cannot modify the system after deployment.

When the game ends, players will have **48 hours** to withdraw all in-game assets including:

> - All **$LORDS** tokens
> - Resources in storage
> - Market orders
> - Liquidity pool positions
> - Any other in-game assets

To preserve your assets, you **must**:

> 1. Remove liquidity from AMM pools before the game ends.
> 2. Cancel open orders on the Order Book.
> 3. Bridge out **$LORDS** and **Resources** through the Central Bank before the game ends.

### ⚠️ Key Reminders ⚠️

- The 48 hour window after the game ends is your **final** opportunity to secure your in-game assets.
- Developers **cannot** intervene or make exceptions after the bridge closes.
- Plan ahead to ensure a smooth and timely withdrawal of your assets.
